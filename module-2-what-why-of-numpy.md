# Module 2: What, Why of NumPy

### Learning Objectives

* What is NumPy?&#x20;
* Why NumPy?
* Importing NumPy

### What is NumPy?

* NumPy stands for Numerical Python
* It is an open - source Python library

### Use of NumPy

* It is used for working with numerical data in Python

### Why NumPy?

* Makes the numerical computations easier and faster
* Consumes less memory

### Import NumPy

Anytime you want to use a library in Python, your first priority should be to make it accessible.

You can import/load NumPy in your notebook or any other Python IDE in two different ways.

`import numpy` OR

`import numpy as np`

we will be using **np** shorthand for numpy. It simply serves as an alias and it is easier to use np instead writing full form ‘numpy’ while coding.

Note: In this bootcamp, we will use `import numpy as np`
