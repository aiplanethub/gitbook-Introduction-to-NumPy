# Arrays

### Learning Objectives

* Understanding keywords
* Arrays
* Lists vs Arrays

### Understanding Keywords

Before jumping into what arrays are all about, we need to recap what we learnt about Lists in “Introduction to Python Programming” course. In addition, we need to learn about some keywords such as a “Dimension”

### List

* As the name suggests, **List is an ordered sequence of data. In real life, if you could make a list of things that come to your mind** (or event for any specific purpose), it could be **** something like this –
  * Brush
  * Leuven
  * 48851964400
  * 3.14
  * Mom
* **You could make your own list & include whatever you want in it.** So, in my list, I have included **** what I do early in the morning, the city I live in, my mobile number, the value of pi to two digits, and mom.
*   If you look at it, my list has different types of data – strings, float, and integer. And, this is the kind of flexibility Python List provides. It can hold different types of data types. **Declaring a List is fairly** **straightforward. You use square bracket (\[]) and separate the items by a comma.** Let me write an example -

    A = \["Brush", "Leuven", 48851964400, 3.14, "Mom"]

### Dimensions

**Now, what are dimensions?** - Let’s take an example of box to **** explain this. A box has three dimensions width, length and depth (or height). Similarly, in data science we will be working “N” dimensions in a data structure (list, arrays, vectors etc). “N” could be any number.

### What are Arrays?

* Similar to a list, an array is also a data structure which can hold more than one value at a time.
* **However, an array can only hold a collection of ordered elements of the same data type.**

### Examples of Arrays & Lists

**Arrays - Examples**

* \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is an array of integers
* \[ ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘e’ ] is an array of strings
* \[\[1,2,3,4].

&#x20;     \[ 5, 6, 7, 8 ] ] is 2 dimensional array.

**Lists - Examples**

* \[ 1, 2, 3, ‘a’, 5 ] is a list containing both integers and a string
* \[ 1, 2, 3, 4, ‘b’, \[ 1, 2, 3 ] ]

### Why Arrays?

* A combination of Arrays, together with Python could save you a lot of time. Arrays help reduce the overall size of your code.

### List vs Array

* A list can store any type of values such as integers, strings, etc. Whereas an arrays, stores only single data type values, i.e you can only have an array of integers, an array of strings, etc.
